# Chatbot

Chatbots are computer programs that simulate conversation with humans, either through text or voice. 
They've become increasingly common as a way to interact with businesses and services online.

## Types of Chatbots: There are two main categories:
Task-oriented chatbots: These are simpler bots designed for specific tasks like answering FAQs, providing customer service, or taking orders. They use rule-based systems and natural language processing (NLP) to understand user input and provide pre-programmed responses.

Conversational chatbots (virtual assistants): These are more advanced bots that can hold more natural conversations and learn from interactions. They use machine learning (ML) and NLP to understand context, personalize responses, and even generate their own text

## Applications: Chatbots are used in a wide range of applications, including:

Customer service: Providing 24/7 support, answering common questions, and resolving basic issues.

Marketing: Educating customers about products and services, qualifying leads, and collecting data.

Education: Delivering personalized learning experiences, answering student questions, and providing feedback.

Healthcare: Scheduling appointments, providing basic health information, and offering mental health support.
